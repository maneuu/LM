    <h1>History of Computers</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>When we study the many aspects of computing and computers, it is important to know about the history of computers. Charles Babbage designed an Analytical Engine which was a general computer It helps us understand the growth and progress of technology through the times. It is also an important topic for competitive and banking exams.</p>
    <h2>What is a Computer?</h2>
    <p>A computer is an electronic machine that collects information, stores it, processes it according to user instructions, and then returns the result.</p>
    <p>A computer is a programmable electronic device that performs arithmetic and logical operations automatically using a set of instructions provided by the user.</p>
    <h2>Early Computing Devices</h2>
    <p>People used sticks, stones, and bones as counting tools before computers were invented. More computing devices were produced as technology advanced and the human intellect improved over time. Let us look at a few of the early-age computing devices used by mankind.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Abacus</strong>
        <p>Abacus was invented by the Chinese around 4000 years ago. It’s a wooden rack with metal rods with beads attached to them. The abacus operator moves the beads according to certain guidelines to complete arithmetic computations.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Napier’s Bone</strong>
        <p>John Napier devised Napier’s Bones, a manually operated calculating apparatus. For calculating, this instrument used 9 separate ivory strips (bones) marked with numerals to multiply and divide. It was also the first machine to calculate using the decimal point system.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Pascaline</strong>
        <p>Pascaline was invented in 1642 by Biaise Pascal, a French mathematician and philosopher. It is thought to be the first mechanical and automated calculator. It was a wooden box with gears and wheels inside.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Stepped Reckoner or Leibniz wheel</strong>
        <p>In 1673, a German mathematician-philosopher named Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz improved on Pascal’s invention to create this apparatus. It was a digital mechanical calculator known as the stepped reckoner because it used fluted drums instead of gears.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Difference Engine</strong>
        <p>In the early 1820s, Charles Babbage created the Difference Engine. It was a mechanical computer that could do basic computations. It was a steam-powered calculating machine used to solve numerical tables such as logarithmic tables.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Analytical Engine</strong>
        <p>Charles Babbage created another calculating machine, the Analytical Engine, in 1830. It was a mechanical computer that took input from punch cards. It was capable of solving any mathematical problem and storing data in an indefinite memory.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Tabulating machine</strong>
        <p>An American Statistician – Herman Hollerith invented this machine in the year 1890. Tabulating Machine was a punch card-based mechanical tabulator. It could compute statistics and record or sort data or information. Hollerith began manufacturing these machines in his company, which ultimately became International Business Machines (IBM) in 1924.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Differential Analyzer</strong>
        <p>Vannevar Bush introduced the first electrical computer, the Differential Analyzer, in 1930. This machine is made up of vacuum tubes that switch electrical impulses in order to do calculations. It was capable of performing 25 calculations in a matter of minutes.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Mark I</strong>
        <p>Howard Aiken planned to build a machine in 1937 that could conduct massive calculations or calculations using enormous numbers. The Mark I computer was constructed in 1944 as a collaboration between IBM and Harvard.</p>
